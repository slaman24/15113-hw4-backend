*Used combination of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot (model set to Gemini 3 Flash)*


ChatGPT Prompts:

Using the OpenAI API, I would like to add an interactive Q&A chat bubble on my GitHub Pages personal portfolio website that after clicking on the bubble, opens a chat window and allows users to chat with AI and get to know me more! I would like the website to connect to a python service on render.com that uses the chatGPT API. Can you show me what the python code would look like, along with a simple html file that implements the frontend? Also I would like to know more about the process of acquiring an API key. I need to make sure I keep this secret, this is very important.

How do I give the AI context about my experiences, skills, projects, etc. that it can pull from?

Instead of using the OpenAI module, my professor recommends we use the requests module. Can you give me a new app.py file that implements this?


*Pasted in code generated by ChatGPT and then began to use GitHub Copilot*


GitHub Copilot Prompts:

I am currently working on the backend right now for a Q&A chat bubble on my personal website that users can interact with. Could you help me set up a virtual environment and install the flask and requests modules that I need for this project?

I have my secrets.txt file and I essentially want the code to first look for the API key there and if it can't find it, then look for it in a Render environment variable. How can I implement this?

Ok I now put my key in secrets.txt. Can I try running my code now? Also for the requirements.txt, does there need to be version numbers for the packages?

Does this mean it worked? If it does, are my next steps implementing the frontend and then deploying with Render?
